Tiaog Becker - @tiagudo
I'm a professional from the music industry with a degree in TI and I'm interested in software development for WEB/desktop applications.
I’m currently learning JAVA + SPRING/Spring Boot.
I am looking to collaborate on JAVA projects remotely, so I can consistently develop my skills and interact with other professionals.
